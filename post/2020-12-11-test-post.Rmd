# Reticulate: 

Reticulate provides a robust set of features for "combining" Python and R statements. More specifically, it essentially lets you switch from one language to the other by calling Python from R, for example. Sometimes, it is easier to do something in Python or you must use a particular library that doesn't exist in R. Or, you need Python to perform an intensive matematical calculation or need a way to import/export datasets from various notebooks (R or Python). In these cases and many more, Reticulate can be a life saver as it lets best of both worlds in a seamless way.

## Python and R studio
Below are two examples of R and python working together.

Example 1: We are taking the dataset quakes from R and we are using it in python to measure the central tendency and other aspects of the data.
```{R}
quakes <-quakes
```

```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()
r.quakes.mag.median()
r.quakes.mag.max()
r.quakes.mag.min()
```

Example 2:
```{R}
covid <- "Covid has caused over 3,000 deaths in one day in the United States and over one million new cases in the span of five days in the United States. It has caused the most physical, social, and economic unrest (proportionally) when compared to other historical tragedies."
```

```{python}
news ="U.S. News:"
print(news,r.covid)
```


###Python

I personally like Python better than R because we can take a chunck of information and easily filter out the data that we want. Python provides many intuitive functions with simple syntax that can be used to sanitize, filter, and manipulate many varieties of data better than R. Below, we can extract just the numbers from the data using a simple regex expression. Python also let's you get away with mixing data types and has many interesting quirks, such as "Python goes b" + 10 * "r" lambda expressions, that make the user's life easier.
As an example below, we want to extract just a list of numbers of covid cases from the information provided. To do that we can use the re.findall function, really easy!

```{python}
import re
string1= "These are the average covid cases reported daily per a hundred thousand in the last seven days by state in the United States. Rhode Island, 115.2,    North Dakota (98.9), Indiana	97.1, Idaho	94.3, Alaska	90.5, Ohio	89.5, Nevada	89.4, Utah	89.4, Kansas	87.5, South Dakota	87.1, Tennessee	85.9, Minnesota	85.5, Delaware	82.4, Arizona	81.9, Nebraska	81.9, Oklahoma	81.2, New Mexico	80.9, Pennsylvania	78.6, Wyoming	77.8, Montana	77.6, Colorado	74.7, Wisconsin	74.6, Kentucky	73.1, Alabama	71.8, Illinois	71.7, Arkansas 68.9, West Virginia	68.6, Connecticut	67.2, California	67.1, Massachusetts	66.6, Mississippi	65.9, Michigan	62.8, New York*	58.8, New Jersey	57.1, New Hampshire	56.3, North Carolina	53.5, Iowa	53, Louisiana	52.9, South Carolina	52.3, Georgia	50.8, Missouri	49.6, Maryland	45.6, Virginia	45.4, Florida	43, Texas	40.3, New York City*	40.2, District of Columbia	39.3, Washington	37.9, Oregon	36, Puerto Rico	28.6, Maine	25.2, Vermont	17.6, Virgin Islands	16.4, Guam	9.5, Hawaii	6.3, Northern Mariana Islands	1.8, Federated States of Micronesia	0.6"

re.findall("\d+\.\d+", string1)

```
